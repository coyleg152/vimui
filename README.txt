VIM UI - Vi IMproved User Interface

A Vim wrapper that uses ls and indexes for quick and easy file opening

Requirements:
- A folder in the bash home directory named 'vimui'
- The vimui folder must have '.vimui.sh' and 'filelister.exe' inside

How to use:
- Run the command '~/vimui/.vimui.sh' in your desired directory
- Set an alias (alias vimui='~/vimui/.vimui.sh') for easier usage (optional)
